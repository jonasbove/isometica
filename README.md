# Isometica

Currently, the only functional feature is creating cubes, using the `cube()` function. <br>
It takes in the following arguments: <br>
`origin_x` `origin_y` `origin_z` `x` `y` `z` <br>
Where first set of coordinates is the position of the shape, <br>
and the second set is the size of the shape. <br> <br>
To use the function, simply open the console in the inspector. <br>
Have fun!

### To-do
* Create array of cube elements
* Depth sort cube elements based on origin coordinates
* Add color option
* Make negative values function properly
* Create UI for managing cubes
* Make the site responsive
* More shapes...
